# Past Perfect Continuous Tense

Past Perfect Continuous Tense tıpkı [[Past Perfect Tense]] gibi geçmişte başlayıp yine geçmişte belli bir noktaya kadar devam eden eylemleri ifade etmek için kullanılabilir. Bu açıdan bakıldığında her iki tense birbirine eşit kabul edilse de aslında aralarında bazı farklılıklar vardır. Past Perfect Tense ile Past Perfect Continuous Tense arasında bulunan farklar tıpkı daha önce gördüğümüz [[Present Perfect Tense]] ile [[Present Perfect Continuous Tense]] arasında bulunan farklar gibidir. Bu durumda karşımıza Tense Paralelliği çıkmaktadır.

Kullanımı, **had been + V(ing)** şeklindedir.

## Tense Paralelliği

Adından da anlaşılacağı gibi Tense Paralelliği; bir yapı içinde beraber kullanılan farklı iki fiilin aynı zaman kuşağında bulunması esasına dayanır. Başka bir deyişle Past Tense'lerle Past Tense'lerin, Present Tense'lerle de Present Tense'lerin ya da Future Tense'lerin kullanılması anlamına gelir. Bu bağlamda gelecek noktalara dikkat edelim.

[[Past Perfect Tense]], [[Present Perfect Tense]]'in bir derece past'ı olsa da aslında her iki tense aynı yapısal özelliklere ve kullanım alanlarına sahiptir. Aralarındaki tek fark sadece birinin present diğerinin past zaman kuşağında bulunmasıdır.
